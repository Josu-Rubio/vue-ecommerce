# Vue-ecommerce

This is a project made as a testing code using VUE for a job offer for Decathlon

## About the project

The project is halfway done as the components haven't been fully incorporated to the main View.
As well as the styling has been made on scss but not Sass components have been used yet (Still working on it)

The API call has been made throught axios but the calls couldn't been made directly to the main API because of CORS policy which didn't allow access control from origin.

We created a temporary API from the data extracted through Postman. Maybe decatdlonURL can be called directly from the office.

This SPA show a table of items from a Json API and allow the user to filter them by brand or by sport (department)
